Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository contains three key projects that showcase my skills in machine learning, data analysis, and model building. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each project and links to their respective Jupyter Notebook files.

Projects Overview

1. Customer Churn Prediction
Description: Predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of predictive models to classify customers who are likely to churn.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing and handling of imbalanced datasets.
Feature importance analysis and selection.
Implementation of classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Notebook: Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb
2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on anomaly detection and classification in highly imbalanced datasets.
Key Features:
Data visualization for better understanding of transaction patterns.
Application of oversampling techniques like SMOTE for balancing the dataset.
Comparison of multiple machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.
Notebook: Creditcard_fraud_Detection.ipynb
3. Movie Genre Classification
Description: Classifying movies into genres based on metadata and text-based features. This project demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques for multi-label classification.
Key Features:
Text preprocessing and tokenization using NLP libraries.
Feature extraction with TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Implementation of multi-label classifiers such as Binary Relevance and Label Powerset with algorithms like Logistic Regression and SVM.
Tools Used: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas.
Notebook: Movie_Genre_classification.ipynb
